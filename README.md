# localStorage Mock

[![Test](https://github.com/shinshin86/local-storage-mock/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/shinshin86/local-storage-mock/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This is the mock of localStorage.

The behavior is not perfectly reproduced (The value returned when an unintended value is passed, for example), but the basic logic is implemented.

## Install

This package uses scoped modules.
Therefore, please install it as follows.

```sh
npm install local-storage-mock@npm:@shinshin86/local-storage-mock

Of course, you can also install it this way.

const window = {
  localStorage: getLocalStorageMock(),
};

window.localStorage.setItem('testkey', 'testvalue');
console.log(window.localStorage.getItem('testkey'));
// => testvalue

console.log(window.localStorage.key(0));
// => testkey

console.log(window.localStorage.length);
// => 1

window.localStorage.removeItem('testkey');
console.log(window.localStorage.getItem('testkey'));
// => null

window.localStorage.setItem('testkey', 'testvalue');
console.log(window.localStorage.getItem('testkey'));

## TypeScript localStorage Mock

It was originally a project to create a mock for localStorage in TypeScript.

If you want to use the localStorage mock written in TypeScript, you can copy and use the code here( `src/index.ts` ).
